                <h3>Windows Setup Script</h3>
                <p>
                    For anyone that might have had problems manually installing the development toolchain under Windows
                    10,
                    then Nikhil Dabas has your back with a new easy-to-use installer to get started on Windows for the
                    C/C++
                    SDK. The script was inspired by, and is roughly equivalent to, our own pico-setup script for the
                    Raspberry Pi.

                <h3>CurcuitPython for RP2040</h3>
                <p>CircuitPython 6.2 brings the examples and libraries of CircuitPython to the RP2040. After installing
                    via UF2, a CIRCUITPY drive appears with code.py. Edit it with your favorite text editor to start
                    coding. The code will re-run after the file is saved.</p>

                    FeatherWing, are fully supported.</p>
